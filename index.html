<h2 class="card-panel orange accent-4">How I installed the materialize framework and built the page using it:</h2> 

<p class="card-panel green accent-4">I installed the materialize framework by linking it inline within my index.html file in the head portion, thus similarly
importing it like I would any ordinary external CSS. With the framework being properly installed/imported I was now able
to take advantage of all the predefined styling specifications it provides with its unique class names that I ended up applying
to the html elements that I saw fit. Aside from the body element which was stylized with accent-4 family of purple to envelop the entire site
I ended up choosing for the individual text-based header and paragraph elements to be classified with background colors that contrast
well with purple with the same family but also present themselves slightly as cut-outs seemingly by involving shadows allowing for each text block to stand
out more.</p>

<h2 class="card-panel orange accent-4">Encountered Difficulties and how I solved them:</h2>  
  
<p class="card-panel green accent-4">Before installing the materialize framework, when I first planned to use GitHub pages to host my site despite already having 
a GitHub account and thus not needing to go through the hassle of registering I still faced initial difficulty with setting up
a GitHub pages compatible repository specifically when it came to committing an index.html file to my .io repo from the terminal.
I did follow the instructions as laid out in the tutorial for how to set up a GitHub page but still faced terminal errors when attempting
to push the commit to the main branch. To solve this difficulty I just added my index.html file to my repo directly from the site and then chose to
edit the file completely server-sided instead of editing a local equivalent one within my locally cloned repo and then committing the changes to the server-hosted one.
As for using materialized, I didn't face any particular difficulties as the styling options I took advantage of were simple to appropriately use
on all html elements that I applied them to using specific class names.</p>
