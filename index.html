<h2>How I installed the materialize framework and built the page using it</h2> 

<p>I installed the materialize framework by linking it inline within my index.html file in the head portion, thus similarly
importing it like I would any ordinary external CSS. With the framework being properly installed/imported I was now able
to take advantage of all the predefined styling specifications it provides with its unique class names that I ended up applying
to the html elements that I saw fit.</p>

<h2>Encountered Difficulties and how I solved them</h2>  
  
<p>Before installing the materialize framework, when I first planned to use GitHub pages to host my site despite already having 
a GitHub account and thus not needing to go through the hassle of registering I still faced initial difficulty with setting up
a GitHub pages compatible repository specifically when it came to committing an index.html file to my .io repo from the terminal.
I did follow the instructions as laid out in the tutorial for how to set up a GitHub page but still faced terminal errors when attempting
to push to commit to the main branch. To solve this difficulty I just added my index.html file to my repo directly from the site and then chose to
edit the file completely server-sided instead of editing a local equivalent within my locally cloned repo and then committing the changes to the server-hosted one.
As for using materialized, I didn't face any particular difficulties as the styling options I took advantage of were simple to appropriately use
on all html elements that I applied them to using specific class names </p>
